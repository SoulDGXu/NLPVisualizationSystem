23,Viedoc,Cecilie M.,Pros: We have been working with Viedoc for more than three years and are using the system for more than 40 studies.

26,Viedoc,Isabelle G.,Cons: reporting features could be improved (i.e. possibility to run report on missing forms/data). It would be great to have the possibility to run the monitoring report on the system (as on version 3).

28,Viedoc,Verified Reviewer,"Cons: The need to jump in and out of the AE, Conmed and Med History pages to find sequence numbers for related items is inconvenient.

33,Viedoc,Andries C.,"Overall: After 20 trials and counting, ViedocV4 has proven itself as one of the easiest and most reliable EDC systems on the market.  In addition to this, the training of site staff including PI's are fast, effective and effortless, as Viedoc is the most uncomplicated EDC platform ever experienced by Novotech and sites alike.  Site staff as the number one client in terms of end user, find Viedoc very ease of use and navigate.  This should be one of key factors and selling points when it comes to EDC platforms.  Viedoc ticks all the boxes for Novotech and site staff.  From a design perspective, we managed to save time by using libraries and the overall ease of designing complicated forms makes Viedoc a leader in EDC.  Edit check programming is very powerful and advanced checks is also possible with ease and basic programming skills.  The close relationship with the senior management at Viedoc as well as their developers, is unheard of in the EDC service industry.  The team is approachable, very professional and responds very quickly with any type of question.

35,Viedoc,Mark W.,"Overall: To often, eDC systems are designed primarily for Data managers, with the clinical site user ( who performs most of the work) as an afterthought. We have used Viedoc on dozens of studies and have received many unsolicited comments  from site users such as ""Viedoc is the easiest to use and navigate eDC system we have ever used.. "" or ""We are performing another study using a different eDC system and it takes us twice as long to enter subject data and answer queries.. we are recommending to the sponsor that they should use Viedoc for their next study... seriously.""

36,Viedoc,Philippe G.,Overall: We have several studies up and running. Interface design is not only good looking : it offers large capabilities in terms of dynamism. Main weak point is the lack of adhoc on-line reporting.,50,4.294117647058823,4.705882352941177,4.294117647058823,4.0,5.0,4.323529411764706,0

38,Viedoc,Rolf Z.,"Overall: We discovered that setup times are substantially reduced and functionality of edit checks (in simple settings) works nearly flawless. In consequence the acceptance of the first live study regarding usability, provides an optimistic projection regarding the need for bug fixes. PCG has delivered substantial input to achieve this success.",50,4.294117647058823,4.705882352941177,4.294117647058823,4.0,5.0,4.323529411764706,0
39,Viedoc,Margreet o.,"Comments: As a small CRO in the orphan niche, we don't need all the bells and whistles (and the corresponding pricing model!).  What we do need is a flexible and user-friendly EDC solution, that allows us to adequately capture the data for our small (in terms of subject numbers) but often highly complex clinical trials for which every data-point matters. The expertise from the PCG solutions staff is a great support when designing effective data capture solutions. Our trials are often run by site staff that is not seasoned in the use of EDC systems, the Viedoc interface and the flow through the visits with the smart dynamics really helps them to adequately enter good quality data with minimal training efforts.  Setting up integrations for lab data can be a challenge, in our experience Viedoc is certainly capable to load results from not only the large central labs, but also from the small specialty labs, reducing the number of external datasets and streamlining the downstream programming.

40,Viedoc,Bradley J.,"Comments: Data drives the decision making of modern clinical design and study implementation. To achieve the effectiveness and efficiency created by adaptive and other modern designs, data capture systems must be flexible, simple to navigate and intuitive. Viedoc is the best system I have used to achieve this for both the eCRF builder and the end user. Without saying, it incorporated all the data coding conventions required and enabled me to consolidate and integrate data from multiple studies/sources.

41,Viedoc,Vishnucharan C.,"Comments: Viedoc addresses requirements of all key stakeholders - site, project manager, CRAs and Data management - in terms of user friendliness and simple to use interface, real-time metrics, listings that can be generated anytime - all these drive significant efficiency gains.  Ability to export listings and review and compare the clinical data (important to remember is its real-time data) acts as a significant cost and time saver as it reduces the need to program reports outside of EDC.  ePRO and is ability to support multiple languages, reminder features to the patients all help in compliance of the study in a large way. It is very heartening to see the amount of new features being added to Viedoc on an ongoing basis - almost bi-monthly.

42,Viedoc,Hong L.,"Comments: Really easy  for DB designer to shorten the EDC setup duration. Also have the advantage on the budget compared to other system. But the shortcoming is less function modules like eCRF/aCRF sort by visit, lab normal checks, online training for site user. these function modules really help us to saving time. And the other module like riskment based SDV setting, drug dispense, medical coding approval are required for every study, but sometimes it will be requested by sponsor. And sometimes it will be a critical factor when sponsor chooseing the system. hope to put more emphases on function module develop, and I think it is reasonable to charge additional budget to sponsor for it.",50,4.294117647058823,4.705882352941177,4.294117647058823,4.0,5.0,4.323529411764706,0

550,Poimapper,David D.,"Comments: Poimapper is well known as a datacapture tool and I have been using the product for over 3 years as part of an HIV/maternal health programme in 4 countries in Africa. The product generally works well in terms of datacapture on mobiles (smartphones and Tablets). The newer version includes intelligent logic which is useful, although we have had some data issues when conducting large complex surveys. The main benefit is that the data is stored on the phone as well as the server. The webportal, where data is viewed and can be downloaded, is continually improving. Standard reporting and dashboard facilities, however still need significant improvement. The admin control - creating surveys and administering user permissions - I still find quite difficult to use - not very intuitive and requiring a fast internet connection to work well which is often a challenge in sub-Sahara Africa. What is needed in my opinion for first line Managers is a simple reporting tool that they can easily and routinely access as a monitoring tool. Pajat provide responsive customer service and at our request they have integrated a documents section into our application which is very useful - containing all training and project information. We also separately use a mobile instant messenger (MIM)  application for low cost communication. I do believe the Poimapper application has the potential, by integrating other features such as documents and MIM, to become a full programme management tool, not simply facilitating monitoring and evaluation but also helping to improve ongoing programme management effectiveness.

563,iCapture,Christopher M.,"Pros: Our sales team is made up of a small group of young, eager college grads and well over a hundred industry veterans, many of whom have worked for our company for 30 years or more.  Contact information collected at trade shows has historically been written on paper and then remained in the hands of the salesman lucky enough to collect it, allowing no way for our corporate team to know if sales could be linked back to any certain show. The iCapture Software provides the PERFECT solution for all of these problems. It's clean look and simple operation offered our older employees an unintmidating experience as they incorporated technology for the first time and it's feature-rich tools and seemingly endless array of customization options engaged even the younger more tech-savvy. One customization option is the ability to create and program your own list of qualifying questions. We formed groups combined with both new and veteran members of our sales team and tasked them with providing the most important questions to ask to determine if each visitor to our booth was a buyer, a browser or not interested in our products. On show site, the ability to scan both badges and business cards meant that the team was able to engage with more booth visitors than in years passed. The numerous options for sorting and distributing the data collected meant that a master file could be maintained at our corporate offices and copies easily sent to the salesperson responsible for capturing it.",26,4.571428571428571,4.0,4.857142857142857,4.142857142857143,4.714285714285714,4.142857142857143,10

570,iCapture,Christopher M.,"Cons: The iCapture software provides so many ways to customize it's proponents to each company's individual needs that it is honestly difficult to find something not to like about it. The only area I struggled a bit with was the photo management system and the struggle was more user created than a software flaw. We wanted to take advantage of the apps ability to push product information instantly via email to customers who request it.  In order to do this for the 29 components we showed, I uploaded a substantial amount of photos and documentation.  When the time came to link possible requests and responses to the pictures and documentation that would be sent, I realized that I should have used the option to create new folders and upload these pieces keeping those needing to be grouped together organized within these folders.  Instead, all of the items I uploaded were now alphabetized in the one main folder and the task of once again grouping the items needing to be sent together became very time consuming.  The software provided a way to keep the items organized but I wasn't clearly presented with this feature nor did I easily find instructions on how to accomplish the task.  This learning curve was in no way enough to alter the way I feel about this amazing software and the outstanding level of customer service that is provided by Ed and the iCapture Team.",26,4.571428571428571,4.0,4.857142857142857,4.142857142857143,4.714285714285714,4.142857142857143,10

632,Grooper,Gerald D.,Pros: My initial experience with Grooper was to improve our OCR processing. Using the Grooper platform we were able to implement four major projects. We used the CMIS connectivity capabilities to extract images from our ECM system as well as locate and identify documents containing PCI data for compliance regulations from the billions of archived documents.

655,naturalFORMS,Eric W.,"Cons: The designer section is not quite as easy. It takes a long time to edit a document the way you'd like it to be. If you are starting a big contract from scratch, it may take a day to get it set up exactly how you'd like it. The nice thing is, you can make certain areas required to fill in.

656,naturalFORMS,Mark M.,Overall: We're able to sign customers much quicker and in the field by using naturalForms.

670,iMedNet EDC,Susan H.,"Cons: Sometimes it is difficult to only get the modules you want and need for the right price.

676,Ultimate Forms,Verified Reviewer,"Pros: Infowise is a great tool that is built right into SharePoint to create forms and workflows. You are given access to additional field types with indicator bars and other features. If you know how to build a SharePoint list, you are just steps away from learning how to use Infowise. There is virtually no coding to get out of the box functionality that would include workflows, email alerts, and permissions on the forms.

678,Ultimate Forms,Verified Reviewer,"Cons: You can only customize the form itself to a certain extent, it is not like InfoPath where you can drag and drop fields on a page. The form is built using tabs and column orders with number of column settings to setup the form. This allows for less coding, but also less customization. If you need to rename  a field, it's not easy to do if you already have rules built around that field, you might have to go back and fix your rules to account for the field name change. It takes a little bit to get used to Infowise if you are used to using InfoPath because they are very different, but it's easy to figure out.",7,5.0,4.5,3.5,4.5,5.0,5.0,20

I now work for a company that uses DataLabs exclusively for all their clinical trials. This database is the MOST user unfriendly, buggiest, inflexible and unintiutive platform I have ever used.  Prior to working in clinical research, I worked in market research, data analytics, and other data - oriented fields, so I know data and databases and am very tech-savvy.  This database has limited reporting capabilities, crashes and freezes regularly, i.e. multiple times per session, and requires 10 steps for something that other databases can do in two.  Reporting capabilities are limited and data entry is extremely cumbersome.  Anyone preparing to work in this environment should plan for 2 persons to complete the work normally accomplished by one in any other database.
