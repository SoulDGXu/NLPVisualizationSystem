Great design dynamics.,Cons: Not powerful/custom reporting.,"Overall: After 20 trials and counting, ViedocV4 has proven itself as one of the easiest and most reliable EDC systems on the market.  In addition to this, the training of site staff including PI's are fast, effective and effortless, as Viedoc is the most uncomplicated EDC platform ever experienced by Novotech and sites alike.  Site staff as the number one client in terms of end user, find Viedoc very ease of use and navigate.  This should be one of key factors and selling points when it comes to EDC platforms.  Viedoc ticks all the boxes for Novotech and site staff.  From a design perspective, we managed to save time by using libraries and the overall ease of designing complicated forms makes Viedoc a leader in EDC.  Edit check programming is very powerful and advanced checks is also possible with ease and basic programming skills.  The close relationship with the senior management at Viedoc as well as their developers, is unheard of in the EDC service industry.  The team is approachable, very professional and responds very quickly with any type of question.  I have always enjoyed working with Viedoc and look forward to do so in the future.",,Recommendations to other buyers: New version updates with added functionality.  I believe there is inadequate training associated with this.   ,0

Highly easy to navigate interface for users.  Fast performance. ,Cons: Nothing of any consequence. Perhaps a offline capability when internet or wifi is unavailable in certain countries or settings by this a very minor Con. ,"Overall: To often, eDC systems are designed primarily for Data managers, with the clinical site user ( who performs most of the work) as an afterthought. We have used Viedoc on dozens of studies and have received many unsolicited comments  from site users such as ""Viedoc is the easiest to use and navigate eDC system we have ever used.. "" or ""We are performing another study using a different eDC system and it takes us twice as long to enter subject data and answer queries.. we are recommending to the sponsor that they should use Viedoc for their next study... seriously.""

What we do need is a flexible and user-friendly EDC solution, that allows us to adequately capture the data for our small (in terms of subject numbers) but often highly complex clinical trials for which every data-point matters. The expertise from the PCG solutions staff is a great support when designing effective data capture solutions. Our trials are often run by site staff that is not seasoned in the use of EDC systems, the Viedoc interface and the flow through the visits with the smart dynamics really helps them to adequately enter good quality data with minimal training efforts.  Setting up integrations for lab data can be a challenge, in our experience Viedoc is certainly capable to load results from not only the large central labs, but also from the small specialty labs, reducing the number of external datasets and streamlining the downstream programming.

The system's intuitive and attractive interface makes it easy for users to come up to speed in a short amount of time.  On the backend, the available data management tools are helpful during the study and quite sound for managing final study data.","Cons: The need to jump in and out of the AE, Conmed and Med History pages to find sequence numbers for related items is inconvenient.

Ability to export listings and review and compare the clinical data (important to remember is its real-time data) acts as a significant cost and time saver as it reduces the need to program reports outside of EDC.  ePRO and is ability to support multiple languages, reminder features to the patients all help in compliance of the study in a large way.

Our clinical study managers are able to build out each study with little to no help from Castor.   The database is easy to use by both clinical sites and sponsors.  The company continues to improve the features of the system and provide webcasts to review the changes and answer user questions.   The value can't be beat.  As an early-stage start up company we are happy to have found a high-quality compliant system we can afford.,"Cons: The one feature we feel is lacking is the ability of an investigator to ""batch approve"" once they have reviewed the data.

It's affordable, easy to set up and easy to use. What I love most about it is that it improves the study quality so much compared to traditional methods of data capturing. I also love all the automatic calculations (e.g. age from date of birth and procedure date) the system can perform. The ePro feature to send out surveys to patients directly is great! ","Cons: The platform could be even better if it offered functionality to design/structure all variables, definitions, input value options, and calculations in Excel and upload it to Castor. This would make it so much easier to translate (parts) of existing databases to new projects. Also, I missed an option to directly export the database to STATA.

It is easy to find any page in the file we night need and to email or copy any or all pages of a document. We no longer have to go to the attic to retrieve a file and manually search through the file foe the document you need. It is there at your finger tips with a few key strokes. The program saves a lot of space and time. Very glad we have it.,Cons: Not being able to scroll through a file is my first complaint. Not being able to add document to a file has been a major issue.  Indexing of the file is very time consuming process.  You need to have character recognition should be a part of your program. With OCR it would be much quicker to scan old file in to the program. Having to log in and out of the program is also a feature I do not like.  To my knowledge you offer no training with the program so I am sure there are lot of features we do not know how to use. The vendor that sold the program to us has tried to train us but like most programs you only learn about 10% of the features offered.,,,,5

If the primary server goes down you can instruct your users to the DR site docuphase and have no loss of work or time.  Currently to have this setup docuphase will charge you for both as if it was another full suite. I disagree with this and licensing/price around this. It was to costly for us to buy a DR license on top of the primary,  it would be really nice to have.  It would be nice for docuphase to go easy on the price if a company wanted to have a DR docuphase server. ",,,,5

Again docuphase have ways of showing this both by just giving more access or via a custom form.,Overall: Our volume doubled since we chose Docuphase yet we have not needed to hire any additional staff yet.

I also found the document management training at DocuPhase to be very beneficial.  It will be great to see the finished product of the online training and library.,"Cons: I do not like how we have to use three external softwares to integregrate and process payments within DocuPhase.  If one software is down, then the whole check process is at a standstill until the software is fixed.  It also requires you to have knowledge about all of the different systems so that you can find workarounds but if you do not work in the system often, then it is difficult to find the workarounds yourself.  Furthermore, I find that the software has had issues with compatibility with our virtual environment, which has disrupted the flow of our processes.",,,,5

It is clear that it was developed to be used not by developers or even remotely technical individuals.

Poimapper,David D.,Head of HIV Team,,,,3.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.5,Real potential to be a Programme Management tool,"Aug 19, 2015",,,,"Comments: Poimapper is well known as a datacapture tool and I have been using the product for over 3 years as part of an HIV/maternal health programme in 4 countries in Africa. The product generally works well in terms of datacapture on mobiles (smartphones and Tablets). The newer version includes intelligent logic which is useful, although we have had some data issues when conducting large complex surveys. The main benefit is that the data is stored on the phone as well as the server. The webportal, where data is viewed and can be downloaded, is continually improving. Standard reporting and dashboard facilities, however still need significant improvement. The admin control - creating surveys and administering user permissions - I still find quite difficult to use - not very intuitive and requiring a fast internet connection to work well which is often a challenge in sub-Sahara Africa. What is needed in my opinion for first line Managers is a simple reporting tool that they can easily and routinely access as a monitoring tool. Pajat provide responsive customer service and at our request they have integrated a documents section into our application which is very useful - containing all training and project information. We also separately use a mobile instant messenger (MIM)  application for low cost communication. I do believe the Poimapper application has the potential, by integrating other features such as documents and MIM, to become a full programme management tool, not simply facilitating monitoring and evaluation but also helping to improve ongoing programme management effectiveness.

iCapture,Christopher M.,Trade Show Specialist,Industrial Automation,"5001-10,000 employees",6 months,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"From My Initial Phone Inquiry to My Panic Phone Call an Hour Before Show Open, Their Service Was A++","May 25, 2017","Pros: Our sales team is made up of a small group of young, eager college grads and well over a hundred industry veterans, many of whom have worked for our company for 30 years or more.  Contact information collected at trade shows has historically been written on paper and then remained in the hands of the salesman lucky enough to collect it, allowing no way for our corporate team to know if sales could be linked back to any certain show. The iCapture Software provides the PERFECT solution for all of these problems. It's clean look and simple operation offered our older employees an unintmidating experience as they incorporated technology for the first time and it's feature-rich tools and seemingly endless array of customization options engaged even the younger more tech-savvy. One customization option is the ability to create and program your own list of qualifying questions. We formed groups combined with both new and veteran members of our sales team and tasked them with providing the most important questions to ask to determine if each visitor to our booth was a buyer, a browser or not interested in our products. On show site, the ability to scan both badges and business cards meant that the team was able to engage with more booth visitors than in years passed. The numerous options for sorting and distributing the data collected meant that a master file could be maintained at our corporate offices and copies easily sent to the salesperson responsible for capturing it.","Cons: The iCapture software provides so many ways to customize it's proponents to each company's individual needs that it is honestly difficult to find something not to like about it. The only area I struggled a bit with was the photo management system and the struggle was more user created than a software flaw. We wanted to take advantage of the apps ability to push product information instantly via email to customers who request it.  In order to do this for the 29 components we showed, I uploaded a substantial amount of photos and documentation.  When the time came to link possible requests and responses to the pictures and documentation that would be sent, I realized that I should have used the option to create new folders and upload these pieces keeping those needing to be grouped together organized within these folders.  Instead, all of the items I uploaded were now alphabetized in the one main folder and the task of once again grouping the items needing to be sent together became very time consuming.  The software provided a way to keep the items organized but I wasn't clearly presented with this feature nor did I easily find instructions on how to accomplish the task.  This learning curve was in no way enough to alter the way I feel about this amazing software and the outstanding level of customer service that is provided by Ed and the iCapture Team.","Overall: More qualified leads, an organized system for sorting and distributing the leads we did get and the ability to instantly send information to a customer requesting it on show site at a kiosk",,,10

It is so easy to use! It is very efficient and has saved us money (vs rental of lead retrieval units at events we attend). We are now also able to electronically collect leads at shows that do not offer lead collection systems. In addition, we have successfully integrated iCapture with Eloqua, which we also have integrated with our CRM so leads are automatically added to our system.

Also impossible to set up manually an affected quantity to 1 unit. It's also impossible to cancel a non-conformity report in case of a mistake, impossible to go back during production. Lot of things that makes VKS hard to use for the operators during production.",,,,14

Using the Grooper platform we were able to implement four major projects. We used the CMIS connectivity capabilities to extract images from our ECM system as well as locate and identify documents containing PCI data for compliance regulations from the billions of archived documents. We have been able to purge large amounts of documents and automated the process of getting document from our core system to our repository has been great.,Cons: Not knowing all the functionally available with the Grooper platform. Our decision to invest in the training and develop a SME for Groper has been very beneficial.,Overall: The time saved using the Grooper platform for automating processes verses manual intervention  is outstanding! Grooper has been up to the challenge!,,,15

The capabilities seem to be endless, I am amazed at how much it can do.    We use this software in conjunction with our Automation system to bring in documents from DocuSign.  However; we are in the process of expanding it for use by our HR department.","Cons: Out of the box it can be very daunting, it has so many capabilities that it can be very overwhelming.  Taking the training class is an absolute must.  Once I got trained I was able to better understand how to deploy this in our environment.  I would recommend additional training if offered or maybe even take the class twice if possible.  There is so much to learn.",Overall: One of our biggest challenges was how to bring in our DocuSign documents and get them into the OpenTXT platform without intervention.  This is the ticket!,,,15

Flex Databases,Doug S.,,,,,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,Why Flex Databases?,"Nov 02, 2016",,,,Comments: NCGS has partnered with Flex to utilize nearly the entire suite of cloud-based modules Flex has to offer for the industry. Decisions such as these are not made without careful deliberation but we had very little trouble doing so when making this one.

naturalFORMS,Mark M.,Co-Owner,Construction,11-50 employees,2+ years,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,Professional Forms,"Feb 21, 2019",Pros: This software is VERY easy to use and upload forms and fields to. It allows our sales reps to provide documents to customers in the field and they can even sign the forms right on their ipad/tablets. Then the forms are automatically emailed to the sales rep and customer once they are submitted/signed. ,"Cons: The app seems to have issues sometimes in regards to submitting documents and emailing them. It doesn't happen to every user, but we've had some have glitches. It's also not very compatible with Android devices, but is very compatible with Apple devices.",Overall: We're able to sign customers much quicker and in the field by using naturalForms. Customers are able to read over the contracts with the sales rep with them standing there with them - which then allows them to ask questions directly to them and not have to call or email later on.,,,17
naturalFORMS,Ashley M.,Systems Manager,Construction,11-50 employees,1-2 years,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.5,Easy Field Use,"Mar 19, 2019",Pros: The forms are very easy to set up. It's also very helpful for our sales personnel to use in the field and have customers fill out information and sign contracts right then and there.,Cons: It doesn't work well with Android devices. It also tends to have issues within the apps on iphones and ipads where it won't allow the user to submit documents/email documents.,Overall: It's been helpful to us in signing contracts with new customers in the field. It makes it much easier than having to fill out a hard copy by handwriting it and/or mailing/emailing and having them sign it and send it back. Being able to do all of it in the field gets the job moving much quicker.,,,17
naturalFORMS,Eric W.,Adjuster,,,2+ years,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.5,Easy to use app for having contracts signed,"Mar 10, 2018","Pros: This is a nice app to have on your iPad. For the work we do, we need lots of different contracts. Since we have this app, it saves our salesmen lots of room. Everything they need is right there on the app. Once it's signed, the contract can be sent to the linked Dropbox account or emailed to whoever it needs to go to. You can attach pictures to each contract as well. Our guys live the ease of this app. ","Cons: The designer section is not quite as easy. It takes a long time to edit a document the way you'd like it to be. If you are starting a big contract from scratch, it may take a day to get it set up exactly how you'd like it. The nice thing is, you can make certain areas required to fill in. You can do a lot with it, but it can be a pain to get it done. ",,,,17

iMedNet EDC,Susan H.,Founder and Principal,Research,Self-employed,6-12 months,5.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.5,Been using iMedNet EDC for a year but have been familiar with it for several years. ,"Oct 12, 2017","Pros: The functionality and additional modules that allow for the data to flow easily between.  The tool offers every option you might want from plain EDC to randmoization and inventory management, to ePRO, event adjudication and CTMS.  You can customize the modules you need for each study, saving money.","Cons: Sometimes it is difficult to only get the modules you want and need for the right price.  The company says that anyone can program the system, but that is not necessarily true for more complex studies.  It is important to have experience in setting up the system to do it efficiently and effectively.  A library of forms is not available yet.  Cannot use dynamic forms based on a response for a field.  Queries cannot be ""printed"" to send to the sites or others for resolution (i.e. a paper process).  There are other small issues that I know MedNet will be working to add moving forward.","Overall: Good system with lots of functionality.  Provides a tool that is easy to use and has modules for almost all activities related to clinical trials that use data, from EDC to CTMS.  Provides data in formats ready for analysis.  ",,,19

It's not difficult to use and the functions are all there for EDC. Tech support is ok, but not excellent. It's easy on the eyes (very important because you're inputting in a lot of data and it's easy to overlook things and make mistakes, because of all the distracting sidebars, etc).","Cons: Training might take a bit, customer support can be better, and takes a while to learn where all the functions are located.","Overall: Overall, good EDC software and I would use it for all my clinical trials.",,,19
Ultimate Forms,Verified Reviewer,,Construction,1001-5000 employees,1-2 years,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,Goodbye InfoPath! Forms made easy in native SharePoint,"Jun 27, 2018","Pros: Infowise is a great tool that is built right into SharePoint to create forms and workflows. You are given access to additional field types with indicator bars and other features. If you know how to build a SharePoint list, you are just steps away from learning how to use Infowise. There is virtually no coding to get out of the box functionality that would include workflows, email alerts, and permissions on the forms. I really like how you can add tab level or column level permissions on the form, which makes it so you do not have to do item-level permissions in SharePoint to restrict access to certain parts of the form to certain users. Infowise has a lot of potential to make functional forms very quickly.","Cons: You can only customize the form itself to a certain extent, it is not like InfoPath where you can drag and drop fields on a page. The form is built using tabs and column orders with number of column settings to setup the form. This allows for less coding, but also less customization. If you need to rename  a field, it's not easy to do if you already have rules built around that field, you might have to go back and fix your rules to account for the field name change. It takes a little bit to get used to Infowise if you are used to using InfoPath because they are very different, but it's easy to figure out.",,,,20
Ultimate Forms,Verified Reviewer,,Political Organization,51-200 employees,6 months,5.0,5.0,2.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,Great tool for the money; poor customer support,"Oct 10, 2017","Pros: This has completely changed how we're thinking about forms, metadata collection, and how to use that for our company's benefit. Infowise's tool makes our forms smooth, so it's a lot easier to get end users adopted. Metadata is such a huge benefit, but not an obvious one to our end users, so our simpler forms will really help in that regard.","Cons: The software is great -- the company is very hard to get a response from. It took weeks of repeated emails to get a reply (despite their automated ticketing system), and once I did get a reply, they claimed they couldn't find any record of me trying to communicate with them. By phone, they are never reachable. All that being said, once someone did get in touch with me, I was able to handle business quickly. But it does seem like there's a black hole where initial support and/or sales requests sit for eternity. ","Overall: Metadata, increased adoption, streamlined forms",,,20

Of course, you define both the rules and tasks based on your operational needs. For example, we use this software to automate the capture and processing of data coming from certain web-based applications -- a task that was previously made entirely by hand, in a very error-prone process. By using Kofax Kapow we gain both speed and accuracy in the processing of these critical data.","Cons: The learning curve can be pretty steep, since it deals with algorithms, albeit in a very GUI-like fashion. Kofax provides a complete suite of training video materials but the pace of the trainer can be extremely slow at times. I actually had to speed up the video playback to make them more appealing to watch. However, there is no shortage of tutorials and other learning material included with the product.","Overall: A streamlined operation for what used to be very repetitive, monotonous, and error-prone tasks.",,,22

I now work for a company that uses DataLabs exclusively for all their clinical trials. This database is the MOST user unfriendly, buggiest, inflexible and unintiutive platform I have ever used.  Prior to working in clinical research, I worked in market research, data analytics, and other data - oriented fields, so I know data and databases and am very tech-savvy.  This database has limited reporting capabilities, crashes and freezes regularly, i.e. multiple times per session, and requires 10 steps for something that other databases can do in two.  Reporting capabilities are limited and data entry is extremely cumbersome.  Anyone preparing to work in this environment should plan for 2 persons to complete the work normally accomplished by one in any other database.
